Version 0.8.0
=============

- Default to using lowercase for crate paths within archives.  Most users will
  be unaffected by this change; however, if your crate mirror was setup using
  Romt prior to version 0.4.0 (release in April, 2022), you may be using
  mixed-case prefixes in your CRATES_ROOT without a Crate configuration file,
  in which case you'll need to either add the configuration file or convert your
  mirror to use lowercase prefixes.

- Fix Windows-specific archive file creation bug added in Romt version 0.7.0.
  Python's ``NamedTemporaryFile()`` allows the temporary file to be opened
  multiple times simultaneously on Unix, but not on Windows.

- Add continuous integration tests for Windows.

- Remove support for end-of-life Python 3.8.

- Add support for Python 3.13.

- Update Linux binaries to be built with Ubuntu 20.04 (due to the new Python 3.9
  minimum supported version).

- Update Python dependency versions.

Version 0.7.0
=============

- Support crate file deletion and modification.

  - Previously, Romt did not expect crates to be removed or modified once
    published; however, crates may in fact be removed from crates.io in certain
    circumstances, and after removal a crate may be re-published with a
    different hash.

  - Romt now properly handles deleted and modified crates via the newly added
    ``romt crate prune`` command (which is implied by the ``romt crate``
    commands ``update``, ``export``, and ``import``).  See the "Crate file
    cleanup" section of ``README.md`` for information on cleaning up any
    modified or obsolete ``.crate`` files in an existing ``crates/`` directory.

- Enhance the ``romt crate list`` command:

  - Support three methods of displaying crates:

    - ``crate@version`` (the new default format).
    - ``rel/path/to/crate-version.crate`` (via ``--show-path``).
    - ``<SHA256SUM> *rel/path/to/crate-version.crate`` (via ``--show-hash``).

  - Also display removed crates with a leading ``-``.

- For ``romt crate download`` and ``romt crate verify``, rename the
  ``--good-paths`` and ``--bad-paths`` switches to be ``--good-crates`` and
  ``--bad-crates``, and use the ``--show-path`` and ``--show-hash`` switches
  from ``romt crate list`` to control the output format.

- Support crate filtering via ``--filter FILTER`` and ``--filter-file
  FILTER_FILE``.  This allows selective filtering of the crates implied by the
  RANGE of crates in the INDEX.  Thus, for example, a single crate of a
  particular version may be downloaded, verified, listed, etc., e.g.::

    romt crate --start 0 --filter some_crate@1.2.3 list

Version 0.6.1
=============

- Speed up tests.

- Fix accidental reliance on backported security fixes in Python's ``tarfile``
  module.  The "data_filter" feature was added in Python 3.12, but got
  backported to some previous versions, making it look like it was supported
  since Python 3.8 (our oldest supported version). Now we probe for the feature
  directly to ensure it's available before we use it.

- Move build and release steps into ``noxfile.py``.

- Add GitHub workflow for testing and quality checks.

- Add Docker-based build for Linux, based on Ubuntu 18.04.  This provides
  executables that will run on older versions of Linux.

- Add GitHub workflow for building Romt executables.

- Change Romt's ``darwin`` alias to denote ``aarch64-apple-darwin`` now that
  ``x86_64`` is no longer the primary macOS architecture.

- Note changed URL for ``httpx`` library; add some details on proxy-related
  environment variables for ``httpx``.

Version 0.6.0
=============

- Include ``poetry.lock`` and ``requirements.txt`` in the generated
  ``romt-x.y.z.tar.gz`` source archive.  This allows explicit use of locked
  versions for all dependencies when installing from PyPI.

- Extend ``romt serve`` to support the "sparse" index protocol.  This requires
  adjustments to the ``.cargo/config.toml`` file; see the ``README.rst`` file
  for details.

- Document how to use ``nxingx`` to serve the "sparse" ``crates.io-index``
  protocol.

Version 0.5.1
=============

- Remove extraneous artifacts from the built ``romt-x.y.z-*.whl`` file.  In the
  absence of a specified ``format`` option, these should have been present only
  in the source distribution file ``romt-x.y.z.tar.gz`` according to the Poetry
  documentation (https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#include-and-exclude).
  Now explicitly restrict these included files using ``format = "sdist"``. In
  addition, include ``make-exec-*`` and ``romt-wrapper.py`` into the source
  distribution file to allow building the ``romt`` executable.

Version 0.5.0
=============

- Bump minimum required interpreter version from Python 3.6 to Python 3.8.

- Add ``toolchain download --cross`` feature to allow downloading only the
  ``rust-std`` (Rust standard library) component of a target.  This is useful
  for allowing cross-compilation to a given target without downloading the full
  native toolchain for that target.

- Update list of supported ``rustup`` targets.

- Note the use of the ``.toml`` suffix for Cargo configuration files.

- Note how to configure Cargo to use the Git command-line client for fetching
  the ``crates.io-index`` repository for greatly improved performance.

- Switch to Python Poetry for dependency management.

- Require ``git`` only for operations that need it.

- Tighten command-line argument parsing for shared arguments.  Due to an
  unfortunate design aspect of Python's ``argparse`` module, "global" arguments
  do not work when shared between the main argument parser and subparsers.  So,
  for example, ``romt --readme`` is accepted and correctly processed, whereas
  ``romt crate --readme`` is not a syntax error but the ``--readme`` switch is
  effectively ignored.  There doesn't appear to be a clean way to work around
  this, so common arguments are no longer shared between the subparsers and the
  main parser.  The two main switches (``--readme`` and ``--version``) must be
  given before any subcommand, and the remaining switches (``--verbose``,
  ``--quiet``, ``--num-jobs``, and ``--timeout``) must be given after the
  subcommand name (e.g., ``romt crate --verbose``).

- Allow environment variable ``RUSTUP_DIST_SERVER`` to override default value
  for ``romt toolchain --url``. Allow environment variable
  ``RUSTUP_UPDATE_ROOT`` to override default value for ``romt rustup --url``.

Version 0.4.0
=============

- **NOTE** If upgrading from older Romt, it's recommended to use the same
  version of Romt on the Internet-connected machine and the offline machine.
  See ``Upgrading from Romt versions before 0.4.0`` in the README.rst for
  details.

- Add support for lowercase crate prefixes in CRATES_ROOT.  This avoids problems
  when using a crate mirror with both case-sensitive and case-insensitive
  filesystems simultaneously; see https://github.com/drmikehenry/romt/issues/14.
  See README.rst for details.

- Add ``--timeout`` option to control the timeout in seconds for downloading.
  Change default timeout from five seconds (the default for the ``httpx``
  library) to sixty seconds.  A value of ``0`` disables the timeout altogether.

- Fix toolchain unpacking of archives created with multiple specs and
  ``--target=all`` (see https://github.com/drmikehenry/romt/issues/17).  When
  packing a toolchain archive, the specs and targets are specified
  independently, so typically each spec must use the same list of targets; but
  the special target ``all`` is expanded to a per-spec list of targets during
  packing.  During unpacking, Romt had been detecting the union of all targets
  present in the archive and applying this set of targets to all detected specs
  in the archive, causing problems if one spec supported more targets than the
  others.  Now Romt detects archives that contain all targets for all included
  specs and converts back to the special ``all`` target for verification and
  further processing.

Version 0.3.4
=============

- Fix detection of toolchain targets in the presence of artifacts shared across
  targets.  Previously, a given target was detected whenever any one of that
  target's artifact files was found to be present.  This algorithm is
  insufficient when an artifact file may be shared across different targets.
  Instead, a target is now detected with either *all* artifacts for that target
  are present, or when at least one of the target's artifacts is present and is
  unique to that target (not shared with other targets).  The incorrect target
  detection could lead to ``MissingFileError`` exceptions when unpacking a
  toolchain archive whenever targets not present in the archive share artifact
  files with targets present in the archive.

- Update list of known targets for ``rustup``.

Version 0.3.3
=============

- Fix issue #13 regarding duplicate toolchain artifact URLs.  Some distinct
  toolchain artifacts may share the same download URL (e.g.,
  ``.../rust-docs-nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz`` is shared across
  several other processor variants).  Before version 0.3.0, this was handled
  naturally by the sequential nature of the download operation, but the new
  asynchronous support from 0.3.0 failed to account for the possible
  duplication.

Version 0.3.2
=============

- Fix issue #12 causing the below error with ``romt crate import`` on Windows::

    INDEX remote ``origin`` must have ``url`` as a local file

  Romt requires the URL to be a local path (e.g., ``/path/to/origin.bundle``)
  instead of a URL with a schema (e.g., ``https://server/path``).  The check for
  URL schemas was overzealous.  URLs with a leading ``schema:`` prefix should be
  rejected, but Windows paths with drive letters such as
  ``c:/path/to/origin.bundle`` are local; the ``c:`` drive letter should not be
  considered to be a ``schema:`` prefix.  Single-character schema-like prefixes
  are no longer treated as errors.

- Clarify quick-start instructions, pointing out steps which are one-time only.

- Add probe for Alpine Linux's default location for ``git-http-backend``
  (``/usr/libexec/git-core/git-http-backend``) in addition to the more common
  location (``/usr/lib/git-core/git-http-backend``).  This eliminates the need
  for manual configuration with Alpine (see issue #11).

- Improve exception messages.  For `DownloadError` in particular, embed the
  `repr()` of the associated exception from `httpx` to aid in debugging
  `httpx`-related errors (see also issue #10 for more debugging of `httpx`
  proxy-related issues).

- Support ``{prefix}`` and ``{lowerprefix}`` in ``crate --crates-url``.

- Honor ``toolchain --no-signature`` for ``toolchain fixup`` (mainly for
  testing).

Version 0.3.1
=============

- Fix ``romt crate --keep-going`` to correctly handle ``403 Forbidden`` and
  other HTTP status failures (thanks to Anthony Gray,
  https://github.com/f34rt3hbunn3h).

  When porting from `requests` to `httpx`, the exception handling in the
  `Downloader` class was incorrectly switched from the ``requests`` library's
  ``RequestException`` base class to the ``httpx`` library's ``RequestError``
  class; the former is the base class for all of the exceptions in ``requests``,
  whereas the latter doesn't cover all exceptions in ``httpx``.  This fix
  switches the exception handler to properly use ``httpx.HTTPError`` to catch
  all `httpx` library exceptions.

  - https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/_modules/requests/exceptions/
  - https://www.python-httpx.org/exceptions/

Version 0.3.0
=============

- Add support for multiple simultaneous download jobs via ``--num-jobs``,
  enabled by switching from the ``requests`` package to ``httpx``.

- Drop support for Python 3.5, as ``httpx`` requires at least Python 3.6.

Version 0.2.2
=============

- Fix support for Python 3.5, converting several instances of ``pathlib.Path``
  to ``str`` for use with functions like ``open()``.

Version 0.2.1
=============

- ``romt crate config`` now implies ``romt crate mark``, fixing a regression in
  Romt 0.2.0.  In older versions, only a single ``master`` branch was used for
  the crates.io-index repository, so configuration changes were active
  immediately after ``romt crate config``.  As of Romt 0.2.0, such configuration
  changes are instead made in a ``working`` branch that's not visible to Cargo
  until the changes are published to ``master`` via a subsequent ``cargo crate
  mark`` operation.  To avoid the need to manually invoke ``cargo crate mark``,
  ``cargo crate config`` now performs the ``mark`` operation automatically.

Version 0.2.0
=============

- Switch to using a ``working`` branch as ``HEAD`` for the INDEX
  (crates.io-index) repository.  This ensures that partial modifications to
  INDEX aren't made available to clients on the ``master`` branch; these changes
  will be published atomically to ``master`` via the ``mark`` command.  Romt
  will automatically and transparently attempt to upgrade INDEX to use a
  ``working`` branch as part of the ``pull`` command.  See the description of
  the ``pull`` command in README.rst for more details.  As part of this work:

  - The ``--end`` switch now defaults to ``HEAD`` instead of ``master``, such
    that END uses the currently checked out branch (typically this
    will now be the ``working`` branch).

  - In addition to setting the ``mark`` branch, the ``mark`` command now also
    sets the ``master`` branch.

Version 0.1.3
=============

- Fix failure with ``romt serve`` when using the PyInstaller-built executable
  (see https://github.com/drmikehenry/romt/issues/1).  The implementation of
  ``romt serve`` is based on Python's ``http.serve`` module, which supports the
  use of CGI scripts in the local ``cgi-bin/`` directory.  In addition to
  standard executables, ``http.serve`` also supports the use of simple Python
  scripts in ``cgi-bin/``.  This is accomplished by invoking the current Python
  interpreter (recorded in ``sys.executable``) against the script file.
  Unfortunately, PyInstaller doesn't expose the Python interpreter via
  ``sys.executable``; instead, PyInstaller sets this variable to be the path of
  the generated executable.

  To avoid the above problem, Romt no longer supports the use of simple ``*.py``
  CGI scripts.  Instead, only the following CGI executables are usable
  (depending on platform):

  - On Windows::

      cgi-bin\git-http-backend.bat
      cgi-bin\git-http-backend.exe

  - On non-Windows::

      cgi-bin/git-http-backend.sh
      cgi-bin/git-http-backend

  If these aren't found at startup, Romt will generate a platform-dependent
  CGI script to invoke Git's HTTP backend.  See README.rst for more details.

Version 0.1.2
=============

- Add support for single-file executables using PyInstaller.

Version 0.1.1
=============

- Adjusted ``description`` in setup.py to avoid newlines.  Apparently multi-line
  descriptions throw off parsing of ``long_description``, leading to the below
  error with ``twine check dist/*``::

    `long_description` has syntax errors in markup and would
      not be rendered on PyPI.
    line 9: Error: Unexpected indentation.

Version 0.1.0
=============

- Initial version.
